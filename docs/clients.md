# Advanced Client Management

## Client Configuration Mode

The [`ovpn_getclient`](/bin/ovpn_getclient) can produce two different versions of the configuration.

1. combined (default): All needed configuration and cryptographic material is in one file (Use "combined-save" to write the configuration file in the same path as the separated parameter does).
2. separated: Separated files.

Note that some client software might be picky about which configuration format it accepts.

## Batch Mode

If you have more than a few clients, you will want to generate and update your client configuration in batch. For this task the script [`ovpn_getclient_all`](/bin/ovpn_getclient_all) was written, which writes out the configuration for each client to a separate directory called `clients/$cn`.

Execute the following to generate the configuration for all clients:

    docker run --rm -it --volumes-from $OVPN_DATA --volume /tmp/openvpn_clients:/etc/openvpn/clients kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient_all

After doing so, you will find the following files in each of the `$cn` directories:

    ca.crt
    $cn-combined.ovpn # Combined configuration file format. If your client recognices this file then only this file is needed.
    $cn.ovpn          # Separated configuration. This configuration file requires the other files ca.crt dh.pem $cn.crt $cn.key ta.key
    $cn.crt
    $cn.key
    ta.key

## Custom client configuration options

In case you want to add or change certain client options you can use the third parameter to specify them. This can for example be used in a multi-server setup to write all remotes in the clientâ€™s configuration and have them choose which server to connect to. The following command can be used to achieve this:

    docker run --rm -it --volumes-from $OVPN_DATA --volume /tmp/openvpn_clients:/etc/openvpn/clients kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient $cn combined-save "remote vpn.example.com;remote vpn.example.net;remote-random"

Note that by specifying one or more remote parameter manually, the default remote entry is omitted. This was done to allow you to choose a order for the remotes because OpenVPN will try the remotes in the specified order unless the "remote-random" option set.

## Revoking Client Certificates

Revoke `client1`'s certificate and generate the certificate revocation list (CRL):

    docker run --rm -it --volumes-from $OVPN_DATA kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa revoke client1
    docker run --rm -it --volumes-from $OVPN_DATA kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa gen-crl

The OpenVPN server will read this change every time a client connects (no need to restart server) and deny clients access using revoked certificates.
